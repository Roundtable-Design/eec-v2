				<React.Fragment>
					I left school with no formal education, ended up working on
					building sites, met a carpenter who said he was a born again
					Christian, and was curious because he didn’t look like one!
					<br />
					<br />
					He invited me to church and I was completely unprepared for
					what I found – it was full of young, sincere and normal
					(most of them) people. And was even more staggered by what
					they told me about Jesus, not least that He was willing to
					forgive a toe-rag like me. Still haven’t got over it!
